# Learning Go.
Decided to look at other languages to learn, tossed up between Rust and Go and decided on Go as I could do in browser learning without a compiler.

## Tutorial
At first, I followed through [Google's own tutorial](https://tour.golang.org/). This gave me some basic understanding of Go's fundamentals.

## Installation
[Installing Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) is as simple as downloading the package (~330 MB on disk).

## IDE
On my Mac I have been using brackets for Django+Python development, and Atom for everything else. I decided to continue using Atom for Go as there are suitable plugins.

## Learning through Exercism
By accident, I stumbled across [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) which has simple exercises to practice learning around 40 different languages.

After installing it using homebrew:
```
brew update && brew install exercism
```

You can download exercises, complete and then submit them.

Was able to complete a number of easy tasks in a short amount of time.
